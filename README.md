# Applied Statistics 2019

## Code Repository for the class


## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you install the relevant software that will be used in the course.

Note that you have two options for installing and running the applied statistics notebooks. The first option involves running the code on ERDA, a KU-based server platform that has the advantage of having a uniform software environment for everyone. If you are not enrolled as a KU student, you should contact [Troels](mailto:petersen@nbi.dk) to get access to the ERDA servers. The second option is to install everything on your laptop, using the anaconda environment as a standard set of python libraries. 

We highly recommend that you use __BOTH__ methods throughout the course. Having a local copy of the exercices can become very handy when the ERDA servers are down (for maintenance or other reasons).
