# Applied Statistics 2019 - Code Repository

This git is a repository of the code that will be used in the Applied Statistics code 2019 edition.


## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you install the relevant software that will be used in the course.

Note that you have two options for installing and running the applied statistics notebooks. The first option involves running the code on [ERDA](https://erda.ku.dk), a KU-based server platform that has the advantage of having a uniform software environment for everyone. If you are not enrolled as a KU student, you should contact [Troels](mailto:petersen@nbi.dk) to get access to the ERDA servers. The second option is to install everything on your laptop, using the anaconda environment as a standard set of python libraries. 

We highly recommend that you use __BOTH__ methods throughout the course. Having a local copy of the exercices can become very handy when the ERDA servers are down (for maintenance or other reasons).

### Option A. Running things on ERDA
---

#### Get Registered on ERDA (email [Troels](mailto:petersen@nbi.dk) to get registered)

#### [Get a github account](https://github.com/). 

If you do not wish to do so, you can still access the course content by manually downloading the repository (see __Option C__ below)

#### Clone the Applied Statistics Repository

</details>



<details><summary>Open the <b>Terminal</b> option </summary>

	title="ERDA main menu"/>
</details>


You should now have a terminal window opened in your screen. If you type in the command `ll`, you should see a list of folder in your space. Move into the __work__ folder by typing the command `cd work`.

</details>


Once you are in your __work__ folder, make yourself a local copy of the code repository by typing the command `git clone https://github.com/bourdeet/AppStat2019.git ./AppStat2019_local/`. If you list the content of your __work__ directory, you should now see a local copy of the code appear on your machine.
