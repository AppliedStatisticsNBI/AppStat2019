    "The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test) is a general test to evaluate if two distributions in 1D are the same. This program applies an unbinned KS test, and compares it to a $\\chi^2$-test and a simple comparison of means.\n",

    "# Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First run the program with one experiment (N_exp = 1) to display the two distributions A and B, when:\n",
    "    - They are the same.\n",
    "    - The mean of A is increased (to e.g. 0.1).\n",
    "    - The width of A is enlarged (to e.g. 1.2).\n",
    "    - The normalisation of A is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get a feel for how much you need to change the distribution, before you can _by eye_ see that they are not the same. I.e. can you see any difference, if `mean_A` $= 0.1$? Or how about $0.2$? How do you quantify this and when do you start to doubt? And how about `width_A` $= 1.1$? Or $1.2$? Again, can you see it by eye? Finally, try to put $1050$ events into B. Is that visible? How about $1100$? And do you see an impact in the p-values?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Could you for the test of the means have calculated how much of a change in the mean is needed for a difference to be statistically significant? Do so, and see if it somewhat matches you guess/estimate from above!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now run the tests 1000 times, where A and B are unit Gaussians and thus identical. How should the distributions of the test probabilities come out? And is this the case, approximately? If not, think of reasons for this, and what could be a remedy. HINT: Large statistics is always easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat the changes in question 1), and see which tests \"reacts\" most to these modifications. How much of a change in the mean is required for 95% of the tests (of each kind) to give a probability below 5%? How much is required for the width? And the norm?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Try to test different distributions than the Gaussian one (e.g. exponential, uniform, etc.), and see how the tests performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has the great advantage that it can handle ANY distribution (even the Cauchy distribution - remind yourself of that one!). The reason is, that it doesn't care about any PDF, nor how far out an outlier is. It is just a matter of the difference in integrals between the two functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Obviously, the test of the means is not sensitive the a change in the width. Make such a test yourself by calculating the widths and the uncertainty on the widths (or perhaps try the F-test!). Note that in a (unit) Gaussian the uncertainty on the width is of the same order as that of the means!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Very advanced:\n",
    "6. Implement in python the following tests:\n",
    "     - Lilliefors test\n",
    "     - Shapiro-Wilk test\n",
    "     - Anderson-Darling test\n",
    "     - Cramer-von-Mises test\n",
    "     - Jarque-Bera test\n",
    "     - Kuiper's test\n",
    "     - Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test\n",
    "     - Siegel-Tukey test\n",
    "     \n",
    "and quantify under various conditions and datasets the power of each and the correlation among them. Write it up, and send it to a statistics journal. :-)"
