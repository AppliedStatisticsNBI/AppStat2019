That is true, but the rule definitely has its limitations, since \"around\" depends on the size of Ndof! This is examplified below, considering two cases with the same reduced chisquare of 1.5, but with **very** different conclusions.\n",

From the central limit theorem, the $\\chi^2$ should approach a Gaussian for \"large\" values of k (k > 50 is probably enough), but the **relative** width (i.e. width/mean) becomes smaller and smaller as k grows, and a reduced chisquare of e.g. 1.5 becomes more and more unlikely."

    " 1) Run the code such that it does exactly one fit (initial setting), and take a look at the line fitted.\n",

    "\n",
    " 2) Does the fit reproduce the input numbers well (include the uncertainties in your\n",
    "    answer)?\n",
    "\n",
    " 3) Now increase the number of experiments to e.g. 1000, and rerun the macro. Figure\n",
    "    out what you see in the window split in 2-by-2, and go through each of these to\n",
    "    see, if you understand every feature of the distributions shown, and if you are\n",
    "    happy with them! Is this what you expected? Are they also as wide as you would expect?\n",
    "    Possibly try to make some fits of these output distributions to check, if you're satisfied!\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    This somehow makes this the \"long\" question without any leading questions.\n",
    "    But you should try to be statistically minded enough and have an idea of what to\n",
    "    look for, at least to some degree. We will discuss this further in class.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4) Investigate if the distributions of probabilities is flat, or if it has some\n",
    "    slope to it. Do you understand why the distributions of probabilities is flat?\n",
    "    (This is typically conceptually hard to begin with, but don't worry!)\n",
    "\n",
    " 5) Find the line of code where the random points for the line are generated, and add a\n",
    "    quadratic term in x with the coefficient alpha2 = -0.04. Run the program again with Nexp=1,\n",
